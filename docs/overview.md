# Stacks.js Overview

Stacks.js is the Stacks SDK for building on the Stacks blockchain with JavaScript.
It's a collection of various JavaScript libraries allowing developers to build interactive user experiences for their users.
From [authenticating users](https://docs.hiro.so/stacks.js/feature-guides/authenticate-users-with-connect) to [creating post-conditions](https://dev.to/stacks/understanding-stacks-post-conditions-e65), Stacks.js is an indispensible part of the developer's toolkit.

<!-- todo: Ensure these examples are the most commonly asked questions in Discord. -->
<!-- todo: We need to have a post-conditions guide within our docs.... No? -->
<!-- todo: Create links for these two examplesâ€”signing transactions and creating post-conditions. -->
<!-- todo: add better UI, e.g. grid of cards -->


<!-- LEAVING OUT -->
<!-- There are two main ways developers build applications on the Stacks blockchain:

- ðŸ”’ **Without Direct Private Key Access**: For example, a web app that allows users to interact with the Stacks blockchain using their Stacks wallet (browser extension or mobile). Read More in the Connect Guide
- ðŸ”‘ **With Private Key Access**: For example, managing funds with the Stacks.js CLI, building a backend (which can sign transactions directly).

Most users interact via their favorite Stacks wallet.
Developers can build web apps, which prompt the user for an action (e.g. sign a transaction), and then the wallet will handle the rest.
The wallet will act in the security, and best interest of the user, and the user will be able to review the transaction before signing.

Nevertheless, direct private key access is needed for some use cases.
Developers can build simple scripts and tools intended for "offline" use.
Users may use the Stacks.js CLI directly to send a transaction.
Backends may need to automate signing without direct user interaction.
In these cases, developers can use the same libraries used by Stacks wallets for account handling and transaction signing.

While there are many Stacks.js use cases, we find that there are three main integrations used by Stacks-enabled applications:

<!-- todo: add a card and better how-to-guide for each, (eg add message signing backend checking) -->

- **Authentication**: Register and sign users in with identities on the Stacks blockchain
- **Transaction signing**: Prompt users to sign and broadcast transactions to the Stacks blockchain
- **Data storage**: Save and retrieve data for users with [Gaia](https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/references/gaia)

You can take a look at this example application that uses these Stacks.js primitives to create new user experiences below!

## Development

There is a main [Stacks.js monorepo](https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks.js) containing most of the packages, but there are a few others often also considered a part of "Stacks.js".
<!-- Can we add these? Not sure how helpful this sentence is without explicit links -->

Are we missing anything?
